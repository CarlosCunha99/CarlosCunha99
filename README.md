# 👋 Hey there! I’m Carlos

- 🇵🇹 Proudly coding from Portugal (yes, the land of custard tarts and sunshine)  
- 🤓 Junior Software Engineer on a mission to make Scala functional code as smooth as Port wine  
- ☕️ Java Enjoyer (Spring, Hibernate, and all their cousins)  
- 🎲 Board-game enthusiast (Catan conqueror, Ticket to Ride tycoon)  
- 🎮 Single & multiplayer gamer—ask me about my latest RPG games
- 🃏 Magic: The Gathering fan—my deck is as organized as my commits (well… almost)  
- 😄 Always up for a chat, a laugh, or a code review that ends in bad jokes

## 🔭 What I’m Building
- **Scala Funhouse**: Pure-function playground where nothing mutates (except my snack stash)  
- **Java Revival**: Bringing legacy Java code back to life—Frankencode, but make it classy

## 🌱 Learning & Laughing
1. Cats Effect (because side-effects belong in stand-up shows, not code)  
2. Akka Streams (streaming my coffee, one sip at a time)
